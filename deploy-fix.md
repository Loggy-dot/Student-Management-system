# Deployment Fix Instructions

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Backend Module Loading Issue
**Problem**: Production was trying to use server-module.js which wasn't properly exporting routes
**Solution**: Modified server.js to prioritize unified-server.js which is working locally

### 2. Database Path Issue
**Problem**: Database file was being created in wrong location in production
**Solution**: Updated unified-server.js to use proper path.join() for database location

### 3. Environment-specific Database Reset
**Problem**: Database was being deleted on every startup in production
**Solution**: Only delete database in development mode, preserve in production

## Files Modified

1. **server.js**
   - Added debugging logs for backend loading
   - Prioritized unified-server.js over server-module.js
   - Enhanced error handling

2. **backend/unified-server.js**
   - Fixed database path using path.join()
   - Prevented database deletion in production
   - Ensured proper router export

3. **student-management-frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx**
   - Replaced hardcoded localhost URLs with API config
   - Added safe fallbacks for missing data fields

4. **student-management-frontend/src/components/AdvancedDashboard.jsx**
   - Updated to use API configuration instead of hardcoded URLs

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and push changes to repository**
2. **Trigger Render deployment** (automatic if connected to Git)
3. **Wait for deployment to complete**
4. **Test endpoints** using the test scripts

## Test Results (Local)
```
✅ Health Check: Status 200
✅ API Health Check: Status 200  
✅ Get Departments: Status 200 (12 items)
✅ Get Students (Enhanced): Status 200 (15 items)
✅ Get Students (Reports): Status 200 (15 items)
✅ Get Teachers: Status 200 (1 item)
✅ Admin Login: Success
```

## Expected Production Results After Fix
All endpoints should return JSON data instead of 404 HTML pages.
